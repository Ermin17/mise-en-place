## A Comprehensive Culinary Solution for Modern Living

In today's fast-paced world, many individuals find the prospect of cooking at home to be a daunting and time-consuming endeavor. Recognizing this challenge, we have developed Mise en Place, an innovative application designed to transform reluctant home cooks into passionate culinary enthusiasts.

As modern lifestyles demand efficiency and convenience, individuals with busy careers, demanding schedules, and minimal cooking experience often seek cost-effective alternatives to dining out. Mise en Place is poised to revolutionize the home cooking experience, empowering users of diverse backgrounds to unleash their inner Master Chef.

Furthermore, Mise en Place fosters a sense of community by connecting individuals through their shared passion for food, making the culinary journey more engaging and enjoyable for all.

## OpenAI Integration for Recipe Creation

In order to provide comprehensive and customized cooking instructions to users for a wide range of recipes, we leveraged OpenAI since the Edamam API did not include instructions for their recipes. By submitting a prompt consisting of the recipe name and ingredients, we were able to generate personalized recipe instructions using the power of the OpenAI platform.

## User Preferences

Once users are logged in, they are able to add custom data to their account describing their dietary and health preferences, as well as the number of people and meals to determine how many meals and servings the app should provide. This data is then compiled and sent directly to the Edamam API, which then sends back recipes matching that user's preferences and specifications. The preferences are specifins.

## Usage

The primary goal of this repository was to provide an educational platform for our team of developers to practice building a React application utilizing a microservice architecture. The project involved collaborative work between five other engineers to ensure a robust and well-designed application. By working on this project, we gained valuable experience in developing and deploying microservices in a real-world application using git workflow.
